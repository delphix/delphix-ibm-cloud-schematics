# Delphix Data Virtualization for IBM Cloud
Whether your production database lives in IBM Cloud or remains on-premise, provisioning data for cloud-based application development and testing is likely the slowest part of your software delivery pipeline. Time-consuming, manual processes for consolidating, securing, and distributing data delay project timelines because dev and test teams are stuck waiting on data to be delivered into test environments.  

Delphix is a DataOps platform for application development teams, providing secure data for non-production environments on-demand to streamline IBM Cloud migration projects and remove bottlenecks from DevOps workflows. For more information visit www.delphix.com.

Delphix rapidly provisions secure, production-quality data to test environments in IBM Cloud, providing self-service controls to version data like code.

Data Delivery with Delphix Virtualization
On-demand access to production-quality data ensures comprehensive test coverage.
Version data like code:  rewind, branch, and share datasets from any point in time.
Virtualized datasets non-disruptively sync with production instances.
